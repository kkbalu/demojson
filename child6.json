A/Co remarkd not entered in logbook however noted in GPS log; Emphasis seems to be on entering generic commenst such as \"Compasses compared, Courses Checked\" instead of making relevant significant event entries,   \r\n16. Safety depth entry was incorrect; error in calculation,   \r\n17. Excessive Oil noted in saveall under #1 Steering gear Hydraulic morot oil seal,   \r\n18. Engineer officer to be familiar with entering the record for the testing of alarms for steering gear as part of the pre-arrival and pre-departure routine (this is otherwise to be weekly routine if too many frequent ports),   \r\n19. 110V Low Insulation reading around 4 Mohm; alarm setting is at 5 Mohm but presently keeping lower setting,   \r\n20. Soft patch on discharge side of Fire and GS pump - to enter into SHIPPALM,   \r\n21. Fwd stbd side bilge to be cleaned of Debris / rust stains - slighlty darkened water,   \r\n22. Workshop - Grinder spark arrest flap to be cleaned of debris and gap adjusted to correct clearance of 3-10 mm,   \r\n23. ER Store - aft area to be cleared up of unneccessary items and squared up better - most of the workshop was well stacked,   \r\n24. There was no record of air cleaning filter unit of being replaced after 40 running hours - entry not made; ditto fro changing of compressor oil,   \r\n25. Entries in the FFA log were generic in nature and not accurate - for eg all SCBA bottles had 150 bar pressure (including the spare bottles) though only 4 bottles were routinely charged every week,   \r\n26. Monthlyand quarterly FFA entries not streamlined in log - no entries for Low Expansion foam, list of vents, fire hydrants, Foam and Fire isolation valves and for fire hoses pressure testing,   \r\n27. 2 nos DCP fire ext for Lifeboats do not have any spares,   \r\n28. Oil streaks IWO B/Hd seal for vac pump #1 and #3 (more for #1),   \r\n29. Leak on open side hydraulic inlet connector of V/V WB 328 valve actuator,   \r\n30. #2 WBP and #1 COP casing previously opened and boxed back but nuts not greased and no touch up paint applied over the opened areas,   \r\n31. Thick rust noted under #1 WBP strainer and on adjacent weld seam,   \r\n32. Bilge needs brightening up - too much loose dirt debris lying around - needs sweepeing and mopping","JobId":2438464,"ModuleId":141,"ModuleName":"Defect Reports","VesselName":"LILAC VICTORIA","RedirectScreen":"ShipPalm/QHSEDefect/DefectsReview.aspx","ScreenId":2206},{"Id":[508150,619669],"ProcessFlowLogXId":["3736256","3736256"],"Mapping":"Role","MappingXId":21,"ProcessStateXId":1,"StartedBy":null,"UserXId":825,"VesselXId":102,"CreatedBy":2,"CreatedDate":"2018-05-29T17:12:00.427Z","ModifiedBy":null,"ModifiedDate":null,"CompanyXId":1,"IsActive":true,"ActivityReferenceNo":"18187","UserId":825,"WorkFlowId":88,"ProcessId":1529,"ProcessName":"Defect review - VIR","ActivityId":142,"ActivityName":"Defect review - VIR","VesselId":102,"JobName":"T-IFFR/VIR/STAX-SMPL/2018/May/1262 - VIR -  - Nil Deficiency","JobId":2686213,"ModuleId":141,"ModuleName":"Defect Reports","VesselName":"STAR EXPRESS","RedirectScreen":"ShipPalm/QHSEDefect/DefectsReview.aspx","ScreenId":2206},{"Id":[514782,619690],"ProcessFlowLogXId":["3736350","3736350"],"Mapping":"Role","MappingXId":21,"ProcessStateXId":1,"StartedBy":null,"UserXId":825,"VesselXId":102,"CreatedBy":2,"CreatedDate":"2018-05-29T17:12:00.427Z","ModifiedBy":null,"ModifiedDate":null,"CompanyXId":1,"IsActive":true,"ActivityReferenceNo":"18200","UserId":825,"WorkFlowId":88,"ProcessId":1529,"ProcessName":"Defect review - VIR","ActivityId":142,"ActivityName":"Defect review - VIR","VesselId":102,"JobName":"T-IFFR/VIR/STAX-SMPL/2018/May/1269 - VIR -  -   \r\ntest@1","JobId":2686244,"ModuleId":141,"ModuleName":"Defect Reports","VesselName":"STAR EXPRESS","RedirectScreen":"ShipPalm/QHSEDefect/DefectsReview.aspx","ScreenId":2206},{"Id":[514919,619763],"ProcessFlowLogXId":["3736501","3736501"],"Mapping":"Role","MappingXId":21,"ProcessStateXId":1,"StartedBy":null,"UserXId":825,"VesselXId":102,"CreatedBy":2,"CreatedDate":"2018-05-29T17:12:00.427Z","ModifiedBy":null,"ModifiedDate":null,"CompanyXId":1,"IsActive":true,"ActivityReferenceNo":"18240","UserId":825,"WorkFlowId":88,"ProcessId":1529,"ProcessName":"Defect review - VIR","ActivityId":142,"ActivityName":"Defect review - VIR","VesselId":102,"JobName":"T-IFFR/VIR/STAX-SMPL/2018/May/1299 - VIR -  -   \r\nTest@1","JobId":2686323,"ModuleId":141,"ModuleName":"Defect Reports","VesselName":"STAR EXPRESS","RedirectScreen":"ShipPalm/QHSEDefect/DefectsReview.aspx","ScreenId":2206}]},{"name":"Defect review - SCMM","count":2,"data":[{"Id":[379854,620827],"ProcessFlowLogXId":["3535423","3535423"],"Mapping":"Role","MappingXId":21,"ProcessStateXId":1,"StartedBy":null,"UserXId":825,"VesselXId":151,"CreatedBy":2,"CreatedDate":"2018-05-29T17:12:00.427Z","ModifiedBy":null,"ModifiedDate":null,"CompanyXId":1,"IsActive":true,"ActivityReferenceNo":"11432","UserId":825,"WorkFlowId":90,"ProcessId":1535,"ProcessName":"Defect review - SCMM","ActivityId":143,"ActivityName":"Defect review - SCMM","VesselId":151,"JobName":"IFFR/SCMM/JSPR-SNPL-P/2017/Sep/11 -    \r\n1.
